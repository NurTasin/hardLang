The HardLang Programming Language
<br>
This is the source code for the HardLang Programming Language.<br>
By Creating this Language I have actually showed that how Hard a programming language could.<br>
This Language is built on top of C/C++ Programming Language.<br>
This programm transpiles a hardlang code to a c++ file and compiles it then using g++<br>
This Programming language can include other hardLang or C++ file using `#include<HEADER_NAME>`<br>
